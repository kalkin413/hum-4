Why does he use "we" to refer to his birth culture if he considers himself an Englishman?
- he sees himself as someone that identifies with multiple cultures, someone that can move between cultures

Something famililar and different than European
- Maybe he forgot the details, or maybe he is making calculated choices to appeal to European audience

Describes his original village as sort of a Utopia
- "charming fruitful vale, named Essaka" (4)
- parallel to Adam and Eve
- Edenlike paradise - kidnapping as a fall

they have everything the europeans want in great abundance
- why?
    - they are not greedy and materialistic
    - they are industrious, everyone contributes
    - they live peacefully together
    - work ethic
    - cheeruflness and affability
    - egalitarian
    - no immodesty

thomas moore - *ou-topos* = "no place"
- moral
- egalitarian
- abundant

equiano adds pleasure as an attribute to this Utopia (Voltaire too)
- dancers, musicians, etc

### Noble Savage

- superior to the so called more advanced and superior societies
- lack the corruption of the industrial revolution
- socieites get corrupted by greed

Slavery in Utopia
- first mention: adultery is punished with slavery
- neighboring people trade slaves
- his village also sells slaves
- some slaves even have their own slaves
- he says slavery was mostly equal, as opposed to slavery in the west indies
- pg 105, "just treat slaves better"
- as an abolitionist, why does he justify slavery?
    - speaking in a language that his readers will understand?
    - politician, not too extreme
    - maybe he really is institutionalized into this way of thinking
    - trying to take slavery out of the emerging racist framework?

views on europeans
1. fear, sees Europeans as cruel and savage (pg35, 36, 48)
2. amazement (pg40, 50, 62)
3. desire for assimilation, starts calling them countrymen, sees them as superior to his own kind (pg62)

why does Equiano advance an attitude of biological racism?
- stockholm syndrome?
- speaking the language of his audience

self perception
1. self abnegation
2. internalized oppression

he is forever a slave, even when he is physically freed

why does equiano view himself as inferior and claim to be responsible for his own condition?
- psychology of an victim of abuse

Unexpected aspects of narrative
- never rejects the dominance of his masters but rather accepts the superiority of European culture and strives to be part of it 
- Never actively seeks to recover the language and culture of his ancestors
- Narrative is not focused on loss but on gain - how to become free? how to become an assimilated Englishmen, ie.e. member of culture that enslaved him?
    - pg79 "i thought now of nothing but being freed, and working for myself, and thereby getting money to enable me to get a good education"
- determied to gain freedom through the system rather than subvert it, i.e. escape
    - "i hoped, if ever i was freed, whilst i was used well, it should be by honest means" (121)
- finds solace in the literature and religion of his captives; quotes bible and European authors

this narrative would have been proof that the uncivilized people of color can become civilized like the white man

- what today enslaves our minds and blinds us to violations of human rights, that we will maybe later recognize?

## Voltaire and Intro to Enlightenment

Immanuel Kant
- What is Enlightenment?
- "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity."

Immaturity is the inability to use one's understanding without guidance from another
- "inability to speak for oneself"
- state of dependency

"self-imposed immaturity" = lack of determination to think act independently

"emergence from self-imposed immaturity" = intellectual liberation, self-reliance, and pursuit of agency

Immaturity is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding, but in lack of resolve and courage to ues it without guidance from another. *Sapere Aude!* [dare to know] Have courage to use your own understanding!" - that is the motto of enlightenment"

Voltaire
- "I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it"
- open discourse
- optimistic view of human progress
- concerned with how blind optimism could impede human praggress

Kant: state of transtion from passive thought to active involvement in the world
- humans must now think independently and take responsibility for how their thought is expressed in the world

Voltaire is interested in the real world implications of Enlightenment thought. What does it mean not to just think of these things, but to apply them to the world and be responsible for them?
- in candide, he takes up the enlightenment's focus on optimism

Optimism (general attidude)
- confidence in favorible outcome

Philosohpical optimism (systematic philosphy)
- argument that nature operated by laws of optimization; everything happens fo rthe best
- now called "blind optimism" leads to delusion
- we tend to explain away certain ills instead of seeking resolution
- on a political level, we passively accept human suffering as necessary to human progress

The enlightemtemnemtn solution to how evil can exist in presence of an omnipresent God is Deism
- the belief in a higher power or creater that set the natural laws in motion but does not intervene in human affairs or reveal itself through revelations
- God is not actively involved, creater of the clock
- contrast to "there are just things we shouldn't know"

- Voltaire worked closely with Mme du Chatelet
    - she was known for writing the defininitive french translation for Newton's *Principles of Mathematics*

Voltaire publishes *Candide* anonymously to avoid being thrown baack into the Bastille

Questions from *Candide*
- How do we emerge from self-imposed immaturity? (Kant)
- How do we apply Enlightenment ideals of reason and empiricism to the real world

Style: comedic, fast-moving, erratic, fantastical; uses satire, irony, sarcasm, and absurdism

Westphalia = "a paradise on earth"

Manicheanism = "religious phil that posits two equally powerful forces: Good and Evil"

The man of action is responsible for the resolution, not the two men of thought

- "Candid" = truthful, straightforward, lacking bias
- Latin *candidus* - "white" (pure, innocent)

he is "open minded" or "eager to learn" but simultaenously he is impressionable and ignorant

How will he emerge out of this immaturity?

Leibniz
- philosophical optimism
- "we live in the best of all possible worlds" (Essays on Theodicy).

Theodicy
- Type of argument that reconciles the beleif in an *omni*-God with the problem of evil

*Omni*-God
- omniscient (all-knowing), omnipotent (all-powerful), omnibelevolent

Problem of evil
- question of how to reconcile the existence of evil and suffering with an *omni*-God

attempt for philosophers to combine science and morality

Possible solutions to the problem of evil (arguments of theodicy)
- Christianity: what we perceieve as evil may not actually be evil. God knows best; we should not question God's judgement (Book of Job)
- Augustine and free will: evil is not something that exists in and of itself; it is a distortion of good. Humans cause bad things to happen by misusing their free willl
- Martin the Manichean: there is a being responsible for evil in the world
- Philosophical Optimism: there is sufficient reason to suggest that evil exists for the greater good because "we live in the best of all possible worlds"

Leivniz's Theodicy: argument for optimism
1. God is perfect and must have sufficient reason for doing things
2. What he creates that is separate from him must be imperfect to some degree because only God is perfect
3. Therefore, the natural world, which he created cannot be perfectly good.
4. Although he cannot create a perfect world, he must create the "Best of all possible worlds."
    - God is an optimizer
5. There is sufficient reason to suggest that "all is for best" in our world.

His logic might be sound in theory, but Voltaire is interested in whether its practical to apply it to the real world
- practice over theory

Pangloss is a caricature of Leibniz
- "pangloss" means "all language" or "all talk"
- stays in a state of "self-imposed immaturity"
    - refuses to yield his philosphy of optimism despite evidence to the contrary
- completely ignores global and personal tragedies
- why does he not give up his phil?
    - gives you a sense of control over life
    - the world is not chaos. it is full of meaning, because everything has meaning

Jacques the "worthy" Anabaptist
- critique against religious intolerance?
- would have been persecuted by both Protestants and Catholics
- his theodicy is like that of Augustine and free will; humans are the ones responsible for bringing evil into this world
- Pangloss: "Lisbon harbour had been created expressly so that the Anabaptist would be drowned in it" (12)
    - not only is it absurd, it is not practical
    - not only do we accept human suffering, we stop ourselves from preventing it

Implications of optimisim in the real world
- it is not a practical philosophy
1. consolation
    - provides false sense of comfort
    - allows us to avoid confronting realities; living in a world of denial or delusion
2. irresponsible
    - rationalizes human suffering as for the best
    - leads to passive acceptance of suffering
3. humanitarian objection
    - suffering is real but not necessary
    - humans have a duty to reduce suffering not explain, deny, or accept it

"Emergence from self-imposed immaturity. immaturity is the inability to use one's understanding without guidance from another" (Kant)
- passive acceptance or reliance on external authority
- conformity and submission to established norms due to the absence of individual reasoning
- stagnation in personal and intellectual development due to preference for dogma over critical reasoning
- unwillingness to adapt or revice one's views in the face of empirical evidence or new information
- limited ability to empathise with diverse perspectives due to a narrow worldview

What idealogical systems and institutions keep us "immature" acccording to Voltaire?
- arrogant aristocracy certain of its natural superiority (ch26)
- hypocritical and exploitative religious institutions (too many to list)
- Religious fervor, superstion, ritual (autoe-da-fe, or act of faith, carried out by Inquisition as a public penance - chapter 6)
- military zeal (officers cannibalize the old woman's buttocks to avoid abanding their post - chapter 12)
- corrupt judicial systems (Candide attempts to get justice after robed by Dutch priate, magistrate fines him for speaking too loudly - ch19)
- intellectual arrogance (Parisian salons - chapter 22 & pococurante -- chapter 25)
- **dogmatic idealogy: optimism (pangloss) & pessimism (martin)**
- **objectification of women**
- **colonialism and slavery**

bold: systems that keep our minds enslaved

what worldviews prevent us from actually maturing and using our reason independently?

Martin the Manichean with "nothing to hope for"
- cynical view of human nature
- remains reluctant to change his philosophy
- pessimism is a consolation, also makes him irresopnsible and prevents him from helping people
- his pessimism is proven wrong thoughout the text, just like optimism
- can not replace optimism
