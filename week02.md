Why does he use "we" to refer to his birth culture if he considers himself an Englishman?
- he sees himself as someone that identifies with multiple cultures, someone that can move between cultures

Something famililar and different than European
- Maybe he forgot the details, or maybe he is making calculated choices to appeal to European audience

Describes his original village as sort of a Utopia
- "charming fruitful vale, named Essaka" (4)
- parallel to Adam and Eve
- Edenlike paradise - kidnapping as a fall

Slavery in Utopia
- first mention: adultery is punished with slavery

- some slaves even have their own slaves
- he says slavery was mostly equal, as opposed to slavery in the west indies
- pg 105, "just treat slaves better"
- as an abolitionist, why does he justify slavery?
    - speaking in a language that his readers will understand?
    - politician, not too extreme
    - maybe he really is institutionalized into this way of thinking
    - trying to take slavery out of the emerging racist framework?

views on europeans
1. fear, sees Europeans as cruel and savage (pg35, 36, 48)
2. amazement (pg40, 50, 62)
3. desire for assimilation, starts calling them countrymen, sees them as superior to his own kind (pg62)

- stockholm syndrome?
- speaking the language of his audience

1. self abnegation
2. internalized oppression

he is forever a slave, even when he is physically freed

why does equiano view himself as inferior and claim to be responsible for his own condition?
- psychology of an victim of abuse

Unexpected aspects of narrative
- never rejects the dominance of his masters but rather accepts the superiority of European culture and strives to be part of it 
- Never actively seeks to recover the language and culture of his ancestors
- Narrative is not focused on loss but on gain - how to become free? how to become an assimilated Englishmen, ie.e. member of culture that enslaved him?
    - pg79 "i thought now of nothing but being freed, and working for myself, and thereby getting money to enable me to get a good education"
- determied to gain freedom through the system rather than subvert it, i.e. escape
    - "i hoped, if ever i was freed, whilst i was used well, it should be by honest means" (121)
- finds solace in the literature and religion of his captives; quotes bible and European authors

this narrative would have been proof that the uncivilized people of color can become civilized like the white man

- what today enslaves our minds and blinds us to violations of human rights, that we will maybe later recognize?

## Voltaire and Intro to Enlightenment

Immanuel Kant
- What is Enlightenment?
- "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity."

Immaturity is the inability to use one's understanding without guidance from another
- "inability to speak for oneself"
- state of dependency

"self-imposed immaturity" = lack of determination to think act independently

"emergence from self-imposed immaturity" = intellectual liberation, self-reliance, and pursuit of agency

Immaturity is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding, but in lack of resolve and courage to ues it without guidance from another. *Sapere Aude!* [dare to know] Have courage to use your own understanding!" - that is the motto of enlightenment"

Voltaire
- "I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it"
- open discourse
- optimistic view of human progress
- concerned with how blind optimism could impede human praggress

Kant: state of transtion from passive thought to active involvement in the world
- humans must now think independently and take responsibility for how their thought is expressed in the world

Voltaire is interested in the real world implications of Enlightenment thought. What does it mean not to just think of these things, but to apply them to the world and be responsible for them?
- in candide, he takes up the enlightenment's focus on optimism

Optimism (general attidude)
- confidence in favorible outcome

Philosohpical optimism (systematic philosphy)
- argument that nature operated by laws of optimization; everything happens fo rthe best
- now called "blind optimism" leads to delusion
- we tend to explain away certain ills instead of seeking resolution
- on a political level, we passively accept human suffering as necessary to human progress

The enlightemtemnemtn solution to how evil can exist in presence of an omnipresent God is Deism
- the beleif in a higher power or creater that set the natural laws in motion but does not intervene in human affairs or reveal itself through revelations
- God is not actively involved, creater of the clock
