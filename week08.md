### Lecture on Haiti
- Chicago World's Fair
- Opening of Haitian Pavillion
- Speech delivered January 2, 1893
- Audience of 1500 people

Rumors about haiti
- reports of barbarian-like lifestyle, people engaging in Voodo, child sacrifice, nudity
- claims that Haitian people, because they are black, are lazy an dunproductive and therefore not deserving of self-government
- Fear that internal conflicct in Haiti will spill over to other nations causing insurgence and political instability elsewhere

Douglass' Project
- Belie the cultural rumors
- SHow Haiti's historical significance
- Defend Haiti's political independence
- Reject suggestion that emancipated Black people in America should go to Haiti or "return" to Africa

The way one confirms their place is society is not by leaving it

### Romanticism

Beethoven
- "Go on, do practice art alone but to penetrate to her heart; she deserves it, for art and science only can raise man to godhood"
    - a call to live your life in action. a call to agency, a rejection of passivity. "sleepwalking"
    - "penetrate" not cultivate. more urgency, not something that you do slowly over time but now, in the moment
    - omniscience, omnibenevolent, omni{powerful} acheived through science and art
    - practice art so that you can be actualized (not so you can be improved)
- "When I consider myself in connection with the universe, what am I and what is he whom we call the greatest?"
    - we have a fundemantal interconnection to something greater than ourselves
    - we find meaning not through isolation but through participation in something greater
    - he loses his hearing, living in isolation, and he yearns to participate

Henry David Thoreau
- "I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear [...] I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life" (8)
    - get to the very source of life. call to action - no more passive recipience. take your life for yourselves
    - it's not about improving yourself, it's about actualizing yourself
- "The universe constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions; whether we travel fast or slow, the track is laid for us"
    - call for active agency in the determination of our own lives
    - turn our suffering into love, for ourselves and for the world to which we are interconnected

Mysticism: transendence through letting go.
- meditation/yoga, letting go of lives challenges through letting go
- ecstatics: moving out of the current state into a detached state

Here we have the opposite. the act is not of letting go, but of chasing something to get to that transendence.
- Being active and involved in every step and moment of that transcendent journey
- Transcendence is only possible through a medium
- for Beethoven, its music. For Thoreau its nature
    - both have:
    - rythms and patterns
    - harmony and balance
    - sublime
    - universal

As opposed to the oppressive, disordered structure of society

Transcendantalism
- subset of romanticism
- philosophical and literary movement that emerged in the United States in the the early to mid-19th century influenced by Romanticism & Eastern philsophy
    - nirvana: self-actualization
- Individual as self-reliant
- Nature as a source of knowledge
- Spirituality not religion
- Optimism
- Social reform

Transcendentalism vs Romanticism
- nature is not an escape but a vehicle toward self-understanding
- no supernatural only natural
- Optimistic view of human progress
- Influence of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism

Thoreau on Transcendetalism
- "god himself culminates in the present moment, and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the ages"
    - God is symbolic to him for fundamental truth
    - Every moment is an expression of divine essence
    - present moment is not just a fleeting experience but holds meaning
    - Ultimate reality, symbolized as "God," is not something separate from our immediate experience but is inherent within it
    - To experience the present moment fully is to come into contact with transcendent truth.
    - Every moment is truth.
- "Wherever I sat, there might I live, and the landscape radiated from me accordingly"
    - life is always within you. you just have look within you
    - live for the moment
    - life is not about location, but how er imbue meaning
    - life is about orientation: how we choose to tineract with our surroundings
    - We can live meaningfully at al ltimes
    - Every moment is truth

MLK jr and Gandhi read Thoreau and were inspired by "Civil Disobedience"

Significane of Morning
- "the mornign forever blows, the poem of creation is uninterrupted, but few are the the ears that hear it"
    - divinity : poem of creation
    - awakening of the 3rd eye
    - waking up to reality
- not something that should be dreaded but embraced
- it's a time of renewal
- a human condition

Reprioritizing values: "simplicity, simplicity, simplicity"
- "Most men lead lives of quiet desperation"
    - internalized misery
    - untreated
- What causes thse lives? we lose sight of the bigger picture. 
- "Why should we live with such hurry and waste of life?"
- "We are not awaked by our Genius, but by the mechanical nudging"
