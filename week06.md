difference to be subject to the will of another man vs obedience to law

reacts to robert filmer by name and hobbes implicitly
- both are proponents of absolute monarchy
- all (including Locke) lived during the english sivil war

Locke supported constitutional monarchy

Robert Filer
- Patriarcha
- Defends "divine rights of kings" as heirs of Adam

Locke's response: empiricly speaking, it is impossible to trace the genealogy of contemporary kings to Adam

Thomas Hobbes
- Leviathan: named after Biblical sea monster; symbol of chaos
- argument for absolute monarchy from stte of nature and social contract
- "life of man is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"
- authority must be absolute to protect people from themselves
- even oppressive absolutism is better than the state of war
- the case to overthrow tyranny must be so extreme that it is worth the risk of returning to state of war

1. Rouseau: humans in state of nature are good and moral because the are ruled by compassion which prevents unecesesary violence/ war. the development of reason leads to their "fall."
2. Hobbes: humans in state of natuer are in a state of war becaues reason guides us only to self-preservation. the development of gvernment is necessary to curb our violence.
3. Locke: humans are generally respectful of others in the state of nature because they are reasonable; their natural reason prevents excessive violence
4. Voltaire: humans are in war in a state of nature but can be reasoned with

Locke on the state of nature
- State of total freedom and equality
    - in state of nature, humans have total freedon: "state of perfect freedom to order their actions and dispose of their possession and persons, as they see fit"
    - state of nature is a "state also of equality"
- In state of nature, humans have right to preserve their life, liberty and **property**
- People generally live amicably because the "law of nature ... And reason, which is that law" regulated indiividual and communal behavior
    - Reason guides us to respect the rights of others to life, libery, and property if we want to preserve our own
- In SoN, everyone has the right to punish (legislate and execute)
    - he called these "inconveniences"

### inconveniences in the state of nature
- while state of nature is not a sate of war there are "inconveniences"
    - there are no established, stetled, known laws to resolve conflict - legistlative
    - when conflict arises, there are no known and indifferent judges to fairly resolve conflicts
    - there is no authority to enforce law or order (police force) - executive

The solution to the inconveniences in the state of nature, is a political community to authorize government with political power to protect the natural rights of individuals for the common good. (plitical liberalism)

### Locke on Political Power
- political is the authority of government
- authorized (granted and legitimized) through consent of political community
- held in contract as a social relationship (social contract)
- intended to enable warfare of the politicla community

Political power is a right granted in contract that authorized the holder to make decisions for the purpose of preserving property for the welfare of the community

Locke on Property (Chapter 5)
- We have property in state of nature
- property is own person (self/body) and material possessions (land)

Locke: Property is an extensino of self
- we will only agree to form a political community if it protects oru liberty and our property
- social contract must protect the property that we bring out of the state of nature, incl. our person and our material possessions
- social contract must protect our liberty to authorize governement that will protect our property

Labor Theory of Value
- :whatsoever he hath mixed with his labour with and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his *property*
- acorn and apple example

### Objections
1. Don't we need consent of others to claim property as our own?
    - No: there is no need for explicit consent
    - People would "starve" if we always had to get get explicit consent to take things of common use
2. Won't we simply accumulate more and more? "engross as much we will"
    - No: there are natural limits that will ensure that we take only as much as we can use.
    - "as much as anyone can make use of to any advantage of life before it spols. so much he may by his labour fix a property in. whatever is beyond this is more than his share and belongs to others"
3. Is land something that is claimed os is it only the products of that land?
    - land transformed by labor creates private land
    - god "commanded us to labor and "improve" the land; God "gave it to use the industrious and rational" for improvement
    - unvultivated land is "waste"
4. won't there be "less left for others" because of enclosure?
    - no: abundance theory
    - there are more than enough resources for everyones

### Money
- before money, if a man took more than necessary and that amount spoiled ("fruits rotted and venisson putrefied before he could spend it") then "he offended against common law of nature and was liable to be punished"
- money never poils; it keeps "without wasting or decay"
- money is the source of inequality; **inequality by tacit consent**

Two-step social contract
- state of nature -> civil society (political community) -> commonwealth (government)

### How do we wenter social contract
1. civil society (political community)
    - everyone has to consent to exit the state of nature and enter civil society
2. commonwealth (government)
    - majority has to consent to create this

Objection: is contract really a choice? we are all born under governemnt!
    - all born under established government must give either racit consent or exit
    - how do we give tacit consent?
        - "Every Man, that hath any possession or enjoyment, of any part of the dominions of any government, doth thereby give his *tacit consent*, and is far forth obliged to obedience to the laws of the governmeent"
        - if we "enjoy" anything the government procides, we tacitly consent to it
