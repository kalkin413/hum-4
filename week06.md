difference to be subject to the will of another man vs obedience to law

reacts to robert filmer by name and hobbes implicitly
- both are proponents of absolute monarchy
- all (including Locke) lived during the english sivil war

Locke supported constitutional monarchy

Robert Filer
- Patriarcha
- Defends "divine rights of kings" as heirs of Adam

Locke's response: empiricly speaking, it is impossible to trace the genealogy of contemporary kings to Adam

Thomas Hobbes
- Leviathan: named after Biblical sea monster; symbol of chaos
- argument for absolute monarchy from stte of nature and social contract
- "life of man is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"
- authority must be absolute to protect people from themselves
- even oppressive absolutism is better than the state of war
- the case to overthrow tyranny must be so extreme that it is worth the risk of returning to state of war

1. Rouseau: humans in state of nature are good and moral because the are ruled by compassion which prevents unecesesary violence/ war. the development of reason leads to their "fall."
2. Hobbes: humans in state of natuer are in a state of war becaues reason guides us only to self-preservation. the development of gvernment is necessary to curb our violence.
3. Locke: humans are generally respectful of others in the state of nature because they are reasonable; their natural reason prevents excessive violence
4. Voltaire: humans are in war in a state of nature but can be reasoned with

Locke on the state of nature
- State of total freedom and equality
    - in state of nature, humans have total freedon: "state of perfect freedom to order their actions and dispose of their possession and persons, as they see fit"
    - state of nature is a "state also of equality"
- In state of nature, humans have right to preserve their life, liberty and **property**
- People generally live amicably because the "law of nature ... And reason, which is that law" regulated indiividual and communal behavior
    - Reason guides us to respect the rights of others to life, libery, and property if we want to preserve our own
- In SoN, everyone has the right to punish (legislate and execute)
    - he called these "inconveniences"

### inconveniences in the state of nature
- while state of nature is not a sate of war there are "inconveniences"
    - there are no established, stetled, known laws to resolve conflict - legistlative
    - when conflict arises, there are no known and indifferent judges to fairly resolve conflicts
    - there is no authority to enforce law or order (police force) - executive

The solution to the inconveniences in the state of nature, is a political community to authorize government with political power to protect the natural rights of individuals for the common good. (plitical liberalism)

### Locke on Political Power
- political is the authority of government
- authorized (granted and legitimized) through consent of political community
- held in contract as a social relationship (social contract)
- intended to enable warfare of the politicla community

Political power is a right granted in contract that authorized the holder to make decisions for the purpose of preserving property for the welfare of the community

Locke on Property (Chapter 5)
- We have property in state of nature
- property is own person (self/body) and material possessions (land)

Locke: Property is an extensino of self
- we will only agree to form a political community if it protects oru liberty and our property
- social contract must protect the property that we bring out of the state of nature, incl. our person and our material possessions
- social contract must protect our liberty to authorize governement that will protect our property

Labor Theory of Value
- :whatsoever he hath mixed with his labour with and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his *property*
- acorn and apple example

### Objections
1. Don't we need consent of others to claim property as our own?
    - No: there is no need for explicit consent
    - People would "starve" if we always had to get get explicit consent to take things of common use
2. Won't we simply accumulate more and more? "engross as much we will"
    - No: there are natural limits that will ensure that we take only as much as we can use.
    - "as much as anyone can make use of to any advantage of life before it spols. so much he may by his labour fix a property in. whatever is beyond this is more than his share and belongs to others"
3. Is land something that is claimed os is it only the products of that land?
    - land transformed by labor creates private land
    - god "commanded us to labor and "improve" the land; God "gave it to use the industrious and rational" for improvement
    - unvultivated land is "waste"
4. won't there be "less left for others" because of enclosure?
    - no: abundance theory
    - there are more than enough resources for everyones

### Money
- before money, if a man took more than necessary and that amount spoiled ("fruits rotted and venisson putrefied before he could spend it") then "he offended against common law of nature and was liable to be punished"
- money never poils; it keeps "without wasting or decay"
- money is the source of inequality; **inequality by tacit consent**

Two-step social contract
- state of nature -> civil society (political community) -> commonwealth (government)
- government preserves social good by sintitutionalizing property that we bring out of the state of nature.
- we give up law-making and law-enforcing power for the preservation of property

### How do we enter social contract
1. civil society (political community)
    - everyone has to consent to exit the state of nature and enter civil society
2. civil state (commonwealth)
    - majority has to consent to create this

Objection: is contract really a choice? we are all born under governemnt!
    - all born under established government must give either racit consent or exit
    - how do we give tacit consent?
        - "Every Man, that hath any possession or enjoyment, of any part of the dominions of any government, doth thereby give his *tacit consent*, and is far forth obliged to obedience to the laws of the governmeent"
        - if we "enjoy" anything the government procides, we tacitly consent to it

The state should have two branches

### Legislative: Law making
1. the legislative is the **foundation of government**. it must be established before any othe rlaws are passed
    - U.S. constitution, 1789, Bill of rights, 1791
    - In France, they try to create law before they create government to protect that law. THe gov doesn't survive and their revolution fails. This is flipped in the US, where they follow a Lockean proression. First, the legislative branch is established in the constitution and the bill of rights comes after
2. Legistlative power is to govern even the legislative itself
    - legislative authority is subject ot the laws it enacts unlike an absolute monarch
3. Legislative power supports the common cood. Its duty is to preserve society and every person in it
4. Every member of society must abide (be obedient) to the laws of legislative.
    - Obedience vs. slavery (submission to arbitrary will)
5. No single entity may challenge the legislative by passing laws of their own.
    - “Nor can any edict of anybody else, in what form so ever conceived, or by what power so ever backed, have the force and obligation of a law which has not its sanction from that legislative” (§134).
6. Legislative authority is derived from the people
7. It is the joint power of every memeber of society given up to a person or assembly. It represents everyone.

Authority vs Power
- authority is granted by by official means so it is power that is legitimized
- power can come from might or manipulation not necessarily consent

Sovereignty
- supremem power because it refers to a government's monopoly on its ability to govern its own people
- no one else can tell the state what to do in its own territory

In a civil state. The state has authority. it is vested with political power by the community, but power ultimately lies with the people so they can take the authority away from the state. Therefore, sovereignty lies with the people; they vest power to the state so it is people that govern people. people have final say over authority

### Executive: Law-enforcing
1. Execution of the laws of the legislative
    - always in session, even though the legislative isnt always
2. When there are gaps in the law ("it is silent") then the executive must use prerogative for the common good in the "spirit of law"
     - we don't have laws for everything
     - prerogative is "the power of doing public good without a rule"
     - executaive prerogative can be used until legislative can conveniently be assembled
     - eventually, frequency of this should decrease as more laws are creates

To him, the executive is the judicial branch. Even today, we sort of have this dual function since the president is the one who assigns judges

Reistance and dissolution of governement
- it is the people's authority and right to resist their governement when "inconveniency is so great, that the majority feel it"
- when the government is dissolved, the people who are still part of a civil society are free to reform and recreate a civil state

It is possible to do this without a civil war/violence/bloodshed. See: The glorious revolution.

Grounds for reistance: breach of contract
- legislative or executive fails to protect life, liberty, and property of the people for arbitrary reasons (attempting ot benefit private will rather than common good)
- then it culd be said that the legislative or executive has attempted to seize sovereignty from the people and reduce them from citizens to slaves (dissolve the politicla community)
- once the government is no longer acting as a presenetitive of th epeople, , the government enters into state of war with the political community (civil state vs. civil society).
- Thus, the people are “absolved from any further obedience” because “by this breach of trust they [the government] forfeit the power that the people had put into their hands” (§222).

Reasons fo rdissolution: structural failure
- failure of exeutive: when a single person or prince sets up his own arbitrary will in place of laws which are the will of the society
    - when a "prince hinders the legislative from assembling in its due time"
    - breaks the trust in the social contract, and that breach they are tried and executed
- failure of legislative: when the electors or way of election are altered by "arbitrary power of othe prince" withotu the consent of hte people
    - acts against the trust reposed in the legislative, when they endeavour to invade the property of the subject and to make themselves, or any part of the community

Objections
- doesn't the right to resist lay the ground for frequent rebellion?
    - peple do not like change and are more likely to endure than resist
    - occasional mismanagement is not grounds for resistance
        - "long train of abuses"
    - it is not the people that rebel; it is the governement
        - it is the government that rebels against ht eauthority that was vested in them

Conclusions
- what is natural man like?
    - natural man is rational and self-governing (free and sovereign)
    - we don't give these up. we bring these with us into society
- what natural rights do we have
    - life, liberty, and property in both a state of nature and a civil state
- we form political communities as a rational response to inconveienices of the state of nature
- we form political communitites through tacit consent: social contract, step 1
- political power is the right granted in contract that authorizes the holder ot make decisions for welfare of the political community
 - majority authorizes governement by conent: social contract, step 2
 - the purpose of governement is the good of mankind
 - the authority of governement is the legislative an dexecutive authority to preserve property
 - People have the right to resist, dissolve, and reform government as the body politic.

## Women's Movements in the 18th Century

libertas: Roman goddess of liberty
- contrast to women being systematically denied their liberties at the same time
- denied sovereignty
- at this time women could only gain power through men

Marianne: national personification of France

On the dlecaration of rights and men, women are personificition of strenght and virtue

also egalite

Yet, there is a clear divide between what women ar eallowed to do in practice and these allegorical ideals

### Olympe de Gouges
- hoped to expose the failures of the french revolution, and was executed shortly after

4. their sovereignty has been taken away, so according to Locke they have the right to rebel

13. women contribute labor to things so they deserve to have the property to which they contribute their labor. that means women should also economically contribute to the state through taxes
    - argues for economic independence
