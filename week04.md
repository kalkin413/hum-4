### Institutional Inequality: Property (Part 2)

"The failed enlightenment of civil man"

**Individial Initiative** & **Group Consent**
- "the first one, who having fenced off a plot of land, dared to say "this is mine" and found people simple enough to beleieve was the real founder of civil society" (50).

labor theory of property
- labor alone makes land into property

there are natural differences in the way that people labor. what is innatural is not that people labor in different ways but that society consents to grant property on the basis on labor
- "contrived inequality" spreads along with "natural inequality"

Consequences: Consuming Ambition
- "the zeal to elevate his fortune relative to others, less out of true need thn to set himself above others, inspires in all men a dark inclination"
- Earliest property consisted of land and livestock seemed enough for everyone. however, some started to take, either through force, ingenuity, or proactively, more than others.
- eventually, "some could no longer be enlarged except at the expense of other". But compassion no longer encouraged them to share
- Instead, "consuming amibtion" led to a "stifling of natural ambition"

The wealthier men became, the less they cared about the suffering of the poor
- the wealthier you are, the less opportunies you have to see the sufferin of the poor
- physical divide between the haves and the have-nots in terms of the space they occupy

Peope start deriving pleasure from things that others do not have
- "Rich men value the things they enjoy only insofar as others are deprived of them"
- commodification of basic necessities

Consequences: Anxiety
- without laws to prtect their claim to property, people lived in constant insecurity and anxiety
- "between the right of th estrongest and the right of the first occupant arose in a perpetual conflict"
- "Nascent society made way for the most horrible state of war"

Consequences: Social Contract
- the rich man creates the social contract that offers a sense of protection
- selling a product
- running towards a state of inequality, beleieving they are running to a state of equality

ex: a promise of the "american dream" that benefits corporations more than individuals

Moral Inequality: Being vs. Appearing (Part 2)
- the ranik and fate of each man is established not only on property and power but also upon merit/talets and since these attract esteem it soon became necessary to have them or to feign them
- to be and to appear became completely different things
- the death of sincerity
- appearance gets us what we need

"Savage man lives within himself; social man, always outside of himself, knows only how to live in the opinion of others, and it is, so to peak, from their judgement alone that he derived the stntiment of his own existence"

Conclusions and solutions:
- we are estranged from our nature (84)
- personal soluton: the authentic self
    - reconnect with yourself; commit to sincerity
    - "cultivate your garden"
    - reflect on yourself;: separate what's natural from what's a product of society engineering
    - recover compassion

- we have institutionalized unnatural inequality
- political solution: redesign  social contract
- become a citizen not a subject
- "although men may be unequal in strength or intelligence they can become equal by agreement and by law
- transform instituional inequality into equity

## Letters of a Peruvian Woman

Eliza Haywood propogated in her books the idea that women can only acheive fulfillment through mariage

The most popular text among women at that time was Rousseau's Emile
- discourse on oigin of inequality: he claims love is a manipulative scheme invented by women to gain dominance over men and subsert the natural heirarchy

Epistolary Novel (novel written in the form of series of letters)
- creates a sense of realism and intimacy between the writer and the reader

She is closer to the state of nature. While Deterville helps her become more enlightened she helps himremember aspects of his state of nature that he has forgotten

A tribute to the importance of education and recovery of our inner virtue

In response to public critique about Zilia not marring, Graffigny added letters criiquiing the cult of superfluity, women's education, illustrations, and conformatino that th enovel is completel with Zilia's final assertion of independence

Three Discussion Topics
1. Peru as a state of nature
    - The peruvians were less englightened, less knoweldgable, and less skilled than we are, and yet they were sufficiently advanced not to lack in an y necessity (9)
        - literacy and accounting
        - land and resource management
        - engineering
        - government
    - a society that is fully saisfied because they have all the sufficient skills for survival. fully content (as opposed to the contempt in Europe)
    - Peru as Utopia
        - Justice, respect, integrity, education -> moral superiority as basis for Utopian society
    - Soft skills vs hard skills
        - Equiano and Zilia: original cultures as a source of virtue while European culture is a source of education
2. Impression of French Culture
    - French Society's obsession with material possessions corrupts their hearts and distorts natural compassion and altruism
    - appearance is more important
    - being vs appearing
    - lack of sincerity
    - rich conman
    - uneven distributino of wealth vs abundance of inca
        - inversion of ruler providing for his subjects vs leeching off them
    - cult of superfluity: material worship (vs. fulfilment of Inca)
        - "french have chosen luxury as the object of their worship"
        - "superficial pomp" "no intrinsic value"
    - cultural superficiality: narcissism (vs. authenticity of Inca)
        - superficial social relations
        - politeness as a substutiteu for our natural good
3. Feminist Critique
    - The Sentimental Heroine
        - her reason to live is Aza
        - not a person to herself 
        - knowledge is what gives you superiority, not false social heirarchies
        - "the struggle of making myself understood causes me agony"
    - Women as Ornaments
    - Women's education in France
        - denied  enlightenment
        - as opposed to Peru, where she would not be confined from knowledge
        - love of likemindedness
    - women's social role: marriage
        - no legal recourse to laws that protect them
    - "french Men respect women but that the same time they despise them"
    - dont consider women to have souls

Letters 20, 29, 43

Cruel and barbarous spaniards as opposed to vain and frivolous French
- both suck, but better alternative to the evil of the Spanish and as such Zilia considers herself "saved" by the french

Noble savage trope
