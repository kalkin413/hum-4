### From Enlightenment to Revolution

revolution: forcible overthrow of a government or social order, in favorof a new system
- as opposed to the original definition of cyclical movement
- not something arbitrary/comes out of predetermined cycles

the eye of providence
- God doesn't provide randomly, but in return for righteous or good acts of humans

free masonry / deism

beleif in a cyclical history

the "new order" is not just a change in government, but a fundamental change in the way society functions and as a result a change in individual accountabilitiy and resonposibility

a movement from being subjects to being citizens
- change in individual responsibility
- change in accountability
- change in manteality
- change in community

natural rights
- freedom vs liberty
    - freedom: state of being able to act without hinderance or restraint
    - liberty: freedom from arbitrary , despotic, or autocratic control; social and political freedoms which are considered to be the entitlement of all members of a community

### American Revolution

showed how rational beings should assemble and establish a new nation run by enlightenment ideals
- inspired the french revolution

### french revolution

extravagant lifestyle of the crown as opposed to the suffering of the poor
- rousseau pg85

estates-general:
- france's representative assembly; last called in 1614
- clergy, nobility, and everyone else (only the 3rd estate paid all the taxes)

1789: consensus on a need for change and transition away from absolute monarchy when the estates general was called to versailles

guillotine as the great equalizer

### Declaration of independence

they are not states yet, but the fact that they refer to themselves as such reveals that they have taken their destiny into their own hands

the course of human events: revolution is not a random change. it is a natural change, reference to when Rousseau says that he will write a hypothethical history of humanity

one people: new community, not subjects
- political bands are not natural. they are created by humans and therefore can be desolved

laws of nature, Nature's God: tyranny is not natural. reveals beleif in deism

entitled to equality
- Britian has put the colonies in a state of inequality
- moral, unnatural, superficial inequality

it is necessary for us to remedy the nautrla inequality in which we live in order that we may live by the laws of nature and Nature's God

Preamble
- autonomy is necessary for self-fulfillment
    - the pursuit of happiness is the purpose of life (from Voltaire - cultivate your garden in order to preserve life, liberty)
- all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights: what God has given and the state of nature are two separate things
- we have become alien to our own natural rights (rousseau) : we need to recover these unalienable rights that we have been estranged to

governement is not natural. it is a social contract and it derives its power from consent (rousesau)

using reason to arrive at these governing principles

prudence: reasonable caution. not instinctual

people are more likely to accept suffering rather than revolt

declaration of independence as a list of reasons why colonists deserve to take back their rights (not a list of rights themselves - this comes later in the form of the bill of rights)

takes the ideas of the enlightenment and puts them into practice
