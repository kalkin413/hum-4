last time: philosophical optimism

optimism undone: candide's education & emergence from immaturity

Candide is always empathethic to the suffering of others
- his compassion and empathy, not reason, cause him to renounce optimism and emerge out of this state of immaturity
- emotion, not reason
- Voltaire criticizes the Enlightenment emphasis on reason as the solution to all problems

commodification of women (pg 57)

pg84: candide himself is guilty of this
- marries her out of spite and principle

pg28 "feel disgust at one's own existence and yet cling to it?"
- shared desire for life no matter how terrible or difficult it is
- first moment of true optimism, positive view on humans as opposed to everything else before this

pg68 living a life of no choice

sometimes the state of immaturity is not self-imposed, sometimes its forced upon us by institutions
- not everyon ehas the choice to dare to know
- voltaire contrasts this with Kant's philosophy
- men can dare to know, but choose not to. women cant dare to know to begin with

pg48 cant be optimistic if human suffering is something created and sanctioned by human institutions

Gardens and how to live
1. Westphalia
    - Eden
    - fool's paradise
    - ignorance
2. Eldorado
    - Utopia
    - "no place"
    - fantasy
3. Farm
    - home
    - pragmatic paradise
    - reality

El Dorado
- No oppression, no poverty, no greed; abundance, equality, just leadership
- streets are lined with gold and jewels
- people live long and healthy lives [speaks to a wise man who is 172]
- enlightened citizens who love philosophy and science
- Deism is the only religion - believe in a creator god, but no monks or priests; no organized religion or persecution (44)
- Extreme extravagancee
- not arrogant and pompopus like Europe
- sincerity and authenticity, people actually deserve this
- actually the best of all possible places (pg44)

The Farm
- the object of desire has lost her appeal
- the man of action finds little purpose in life; stagnation
- the optimist is a fraud; lives in a buble of concious self-deception
- the pessimist is reluctant; sees no reason to affect change and contributes to stagnation

always in a state of discontent, can't be happy even when all is fine due to the "lathargy of boredom"

Negative reflection on human nature, we always want more and are never satisfied (like when they left Utopia just to be better than everyone else)

Devish -> pangloss (accept, its all for the best)  
old farmer -> martin (disengage! nothing can be done)

life has to be about improvement, not acceptance/disengagement
- improvement = cultivation

"We must cultivate our garden"
- better off taking action that overanalyzing

Possible Interpretations
- External events of philosophical ideals do not gaurantee us a meaningful life; we must make life meaninful for ourselves
- MIndset is important
    - cultivation is not acceptance, denial, blind hope, disengagement; cultivation is self-development, initiative, work without necessary guarantee
    - stoic: acceptance of the imperfections of the world; endurance in the face of adversity, and importance of cultivating inner virtue
    - epicurean: pursuit of pleasure and tranquility through simple living rather than systematic philosophy
- Must cultivate our guarden; not our farm of plantation, not our family, commuinty, country, soceity or the world
    - garden of our soul? talent? project?
    - metaphor for a mindset / place that offers retreat from the chatoric and tumultous world
- Practical paradise: not innocence of Eden or Utopia but place of active engagement and improvement
    - rejection of grandiose, impractical visions for a perfect society
    - emphasiss on the importance of attending to the small, manageable aspects of life.
    - Humans were not created to philosophize but impact themselves and the world (impact others through the self)
- Cultivating your garden is a way of fighting against human nature
    - our nature predisposes us to rely on dogma, passively accept authority, reject empirical evidence that contradicts our accepted worldview, desire wealth and reputation, indiscrimately criticize, asume that we are entitled to receive special treatment

### Rousseau

Why are we so miserable?
- Kant's repsonse: we are in a state of self-imposed immaturity
- Voltaire: Human nature causes us to rely on philosophical dogmas, impractical ideals, and external events to make life meaningful
- Rousseau: So called social progress, particularly the development of private property, has led to the development of artificial inequalities and estraged us from our natural self. The more complex and structured a society, the more miserable we become

What do we need to do to live together and improve our state (state of self and society)?
- Kant: Dare to know! "Have courage to use your own understanding!"
- Voltaire: Cultivate your garde; fight your nature
- It is necessary to return to a more natural and egalitarian state. Only through a social contract based on the general will, where individuals collectively agree to abide by rules that promote the common good, can humans overcome the artificial causes of their misery.

JJR: We praise talent over usefulness and moral goodness. Education does not make you a better person. Peeople only care about how you write and how you present yourselves

JJR: Origin of inequality is not authorized by natural law because inequality arises from artificial social behavior and the institutionalization of property.

two kinds of inequality
- natural or physical
- moral or political

moral inequality os socially constructed difference (not biological or natural)
- moral worth that we ascribe to people based on our perception of difference
- artificial construct that impacts how we think of ourselves (in comparison to others), our moral value (in comparison to others), and our social entitlements (in comparison to others)

inequality: "the condition or fact of having different rights, advantages, or opportunities" (OED)
- "Moral inequality consists of the different priveleges that some enjoy to the detriment of others" (150)
- Unjust distribution of resources and opportunities

Moral inequality is also political because governments intitutionalize inequalities
- governments are established to protect wealth, reputation, and power of some at the expense of others
- political power perpetuates moral inequality

inequality is governement sanctioned abuse

Why is inequality so bad?
- inequality is established and legitimized abuse
- unnaturla = does not need to be how society functions
- Inequality is morally bad because it corrupts human nature
    - normalizes what is unnatural and inhumane, ie.e. fulfilling one's needs at the expense of others
    - distorts desires and priorities = irrational value placed on luxury and excess
    - disconnects us from ourselves (self-estrangement)
- inequality is socially bad because it leads to abuse
    - those with opportunity continue to profit at the expense of those without; those with power use politics for private interest
    - "upon considering human society ... it seems, at first to display only the violence of powerful men and the oppression of the weak" (11)
