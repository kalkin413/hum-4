Newton too beleived in the philosopher's stone. He beleived in alchemy
- Victors ideas were not so out of reach at his time
- Beleif in the supernatural and occult despite being a scientist

Making moral judgements about Krempe based on physical appearance (Frankenstien doesn't do what Krempe wants because he thinks he is ugly, pg 32)
- Rousseau: we are so concerned with reputation and how we appear to others

Waldman as Virgin, Frankenstein as Dante?
- he reframes his thinking

Victor determines to apply to the methods of new sience to answer the question of old science: What is the source of life?
- romanticised view, cold hard logic of the enlightenment infused to idealistic, individual touch

Galvanism: simulation of muscles with eletric current

Victor refuses to tell anyone about his science, when Walton asks Victor is impenitrible
- perhaps he did acheive seomthing so powerful and can not tell it out of fear that it can not be replicated

Desire to be a God to a new species, contrary to original goal of being a doctor
- Megalomania

### Victor as Creator
- "Breatheless horror and digsust filled my heart"
- Dreams of elizabeth dying in his arms (foreshadowing)
- Creature peers through the curtains of his bead, the creature reaches out his hand to his creator and Victor flees (a bad god)
- Creation of ADam, outstretched arms, expressesion of God's love, his desire to commune, to gaurd humans, simbol of his compassion to Adam

### Victor as Parent (Father and Mathoer)
- Victor's pregnancy: 9 months to create human (winter, spring, and summer)
- Creature's birth: "with such infinite pains and care i had endeavoured to form"
    - "watery eyes" and "shriveled complexion"
- Trauama of afterbirth (postpartum depression? nervous breakdown?)
    - "Dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space, were not a hell to me; and the chagne was so rapid" (42).

Shelley's life experiences deny her from being able to care for her child, Victor denies any care for his children
- does your responsibility as a creator end at inception, birth, or maturity?

Creature refers to himself as an "abortion"
- act of creation does not conclude at birth but at maturity

9 months between Walton's first and last letter to his sister
    - 1818 novel as Shelley's maternal creation
    - 1831 revision as Shelley bringing her child to maturity

### Victor's Reconciliation
- The restoration of peace of harmony (individual or communal)
    - Contrition: feeling of remorse
        - guilt: feeling of remorse
        - difference: remorse is about acknowledging your responsibility. guiltiness is self-focused, personal loss
    - Confession: admission of guilt
        - denial
        - deflection
    - Penance: action taken to restore virtue
        - retribution: action taken as revenge
    - Absolution: release from guilt and return to harmony

How does he focus on reconciling himself?

Case 1: Justine and William Moritz
- turns from natural philosophy to moral philosophy
- called back to Geneva, motherly intuition confirms his fear that his creature killed William
- recognizes that his responsibility is to confess, but he does nothing
- says its the creature's fault that Justine is being executed, focused on self-horror

Case 2: Reunion
- overcome by guilt, travels to the alps
- reaction to his creation: repulsion, focused on **appearance**
- creatures reaction: Plea for acceptance, calls for **contrition and penance**

Demands:
- listen to my story
- give me companionship

pleas of a lonely being, just wants to be heard and to be loved
- if my parent can not listen to me, or lvoe me, and only sees my exterior, maybe, he can at least give me someone that i can love and can love me back

But then, he aborts the creation progress. disposes of her partially formed body
- is my duty to my creation or to the rest of humanity?
- what might be the effects of my science?
- starts to contemplate just not what he is capable of doing, but the effects of his sciecne on the rest of humanity
- reconciles not just with himself, but with the rest of humanity

Creature's Vengeance:
- you shall repent of the injuries you inflict
- when he returns, he is treated as an outsider/foreigner just like the creature (and Justine i think)
- accused of murder
- acquitted but again stays silence

Fuseli was the lover of Wallstonecraft, the Nightmare

His reaction to Elizabeth's death: "No creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man" (168)
- victim complex

### VIctors Final Labor
- resolves to kill the creature
- "this purpose ... reconciled me to life"
- "revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure"
    - not a genuine reconciliation, he will never find peace and harmony
- confesses
-  issues warning against ambition
    - he is satan and prometheus (180)
- with dying breath, supports ambition
    - glory or death
    - who did he cause the tragedy to? himself
    - fails to apply his lesson to Whalton

Rousseau's Natural Man
- Abandoned by Victor, seeks refuge in forest
- primitive, human desires
- leaves this natural state and begins fall

Begins living in the Gaze of Others
- enters village in search of food: everyone freaks out based on how he looks
- Observes family and learns language and communication
- develops the ability to read and think critically
- exposes himself, and is rejected
- Discoveres his reflection, and is sickened
    - internalized oppression, (equiano), uncessesary self hate (rousseau)
- Saves a girl from drowning but is shot by her companion

De Lacey Family
- like Moritz is importatn for Victor, this family is important for the monstery
- Creature discovers that the family is "not entirely happy"; they live in "poverty"
    - like the creature: they are exiles, rejected by main-stream society and living in isolation
- Family is joined by Safie, daughter of the Turkish merchant
    - like the creature, she is the "other"
    - gives the Creature hope that he might be accepted as well
    - The only woman that shows conviction and independence is Safie, a foreigner
        - taught to aspire to higher powers of intellect and to be independent
        - mother dies young (like Mary Shelley's)
    - They really protect the creature's state of nature, from falling into the state of morals in civilised society, not physical protection

The three texts
- *Sorrows of Young Wether"
    - first romantic novel
    - epistolary novel
    - man falls in love with a woman who is enganged with someone else, and he commits suicide
    - "Wethere's desire for love was also forever alive in my own boson"
- Plutarch's Roman Lives
    - history of emperors of Rome
    - first time he learns about what the public world is, society en masse, governments
    - "ardour for virtue" and "abhorrence for vice"
        - he felt inspried by people's creation and horrified by their capacity to destruct
        - both in love and in hate with humanity
        - like Prometheus, ppl use fire both to destroy nature and to build it
        - people have treated the creature with vice, and not virtue. Then shouldn't his response be vice as well?
- *Paradise Lost*
    - Sympathises with adam
        - but Adam had come forth perfect, guarded, beautiful
        - the creature was wretched, helpless, and alone. not created in the image of his creator, but as a perversion
        - no Eve to soothe his sorrows or share his thoughts
    - - Sympathises with Satan
        - satan watches the bliss of Adam and Eve with envy
        - but even Satan had companions
- pain and loneliness of enrequited love, vicousness and virtue of human love, duties of a father to his creature
    - he has an existential crisis. "Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my destination?"

At this point he turns from a creature to a monster
- curses his creator: failed god and guardian
    - "Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust?"
    - "endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind"
    - considers himself to be a victim (at this point, it is justified. he hasn't done anything bad yet)
- curses humanity: failed companions
    - realizes he will never be accepted when he is rejected by the De Lacey's
    - declared everlasting war against humanity. feels only revenge and hatred
    - abandoned both by birth family and adopted family
    - burns cottage, kills william, frames justine, kills henry, kills elizabeth
    - justifies his crimes: "I am malicious because I am miserable ... tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me?" (120)
- Rousseau's vision of man: Born good but twisted into vice, greed, malice, and violence by the social world and concern for acceptance of others.
    - "Savage man lives within himself; social man, always outside of himself, ... from their judgement alone he derives the sentiment of his own existence"
    - due to socialization, he could no longer accept himself unless he was accepted by others
    - new emotional cateobires: "vanity, conmempt, ... shame, envy"
- goes from being a victim to as vicious as society as been to him

who is the monster? Victor or the creature?

Creature and creator merged
- fundemantally good but misguided
- want to help, bring benefit, be part of community
- self-educated
- Experience inner turmoil
- See themsleves as victims of circumstances
- Resopnsible for all the murders (directly or indirectly)
- Desire vengeance
- transition from virtue to vice
- Hate themselves
- never satisfied
- Enter world in the same way as they depart (entering loved and dying loved vs entering alone and dying alone)

### Ralph Waldo Emerson
- "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds"
    - hobgoblin as a symbol for a creature that keeps us in a state of mental immaturity / small-mindedness
    - it's easy to fall into the trap of accepting the world for the way it is
    - people in power like this, it keeps us from stepping out of line
    - "to be great is to be misunderstood"

Who am I that my thoughts deserve to be heard?

"to believe that what is true in your private heart is true for all men -- that is genius"
- the highest level of intellect is one based in self-confidence; that your voice deserves to be heard
- "A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages."
    - you will learn more about things by thinking aboutt them yourself then from listening about things and passively accepting them
- thinking for yourself and beleiving in the value of your thoughts is the source of creation

"Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string."
- Our thoughts are inside of us. all we have to do is recover them
- trust your instrincts, and have confidence in your judgement
- listen to yourself. invitation to a journey of self-trust

Emerson flips the idea that adults have more valuable ideas. Adults are concerned with reputation, apperance, and approval (living in the gaze of others). One should aspire to be genuine like a child

Self-reliance is non-conformity to society's "conspiracy" to destroy the self-reliance within its members
- Society destroys the natural individualism within us (Rousseau would say this but with goodness)

"My life is for istself and not for a spectacle"
- glory doesn't matter. live for yourself
- living in the gaze of others
- do we care that we liked our lives, or that others liked us?

Individualism is the source of creation/genius

The first enemey of self-reliance is society's disapproval and scorn.

The second eny is consistencey
- a reverence for our past act of word
- we drag around the "corpse" of our memory rather than evolving with new ideas
- let go of the baggage of our past
- enlightenment ideals: society's progression forward mirrors our personal progression in our lives

We must embrace the originality of our thouhgts and escape the "hobgoblin" that destroys our individuality

What is self-reliance?
- Not living vicariously through others
- Everything you do is out of your own convictions and not the convictions of others
- bold, inspirational. confidence in the self and in your judgement
- courage. figure out what you want AND have the courage to do something about it

Does Frankenstien exhibit self-reliance?
- wanted glory through creation
- even afterwards, no. isn't honest to others out of fear of being judged or seen as insane
- his confession is an act of self-reliance
Does the Creature exhibit self-reliance?
- in the state of nature, yes
- later starts living for the approval of others, and then acts destructively when he doesnt get it

"Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind ... NO law can be scared to me but that of my nature ... the only right is what is after my constituion, the only wrong what is against it"
- At the very least, express your thoughts to yourself
- Scream your thoughts to yourself until they come out an dmake you whole
