Newton too beleived in the philosopher's stone. He beleived in alchemy
- Victors ideas were not so out of reach at his time
- Beleif in the supernatural and occult despite being a scientist

Making moral judgements about Krempe based on physical appearance (Frankenstien doesn't do what Krempe wants because he thinks he is ugly, pg 32)
- Rousseau: we are so concerned with reputation and how we appear to others

Waldman as Virgin, Frankenstein as Dante?
- he reframes his thinking

Victor determines to apply to the methods of new sience to answer the question of old science: What is the source of life?
- romanticised view, cold hard logic of the enlightenment infused to idealistic, individual touch

Galvanism: simulation of muscles with eletric current

Victor refuses to tell anyone about his science, when Walton asks Victor is impenitrible
- perhaps he did acheive seomthing so powerful and can not tell it out of fear that it can not be replicated

Desire to be a God to a new species, contrary to original goal of being a doctor
- Megalomania

### Victor as Creator
- "Breatheless horror and digsust filled my heart"
- Dreams of elizabeth dying in his arms (foreshadowing)
- Creature peers through the curtains of his bead, the creature reaches out his hand to his creator and Victor flees (a bad god)
- Creation of ADam, outstretched arms, expressesion of God's love, his desire to commune, to gaurd humans, simbol of his compassion to Adam

### Victor as Parent (Father and Mathoer)
- Victor's pregnancy: 9 months to create human (winter, spring, and summer)
- Creature's birth: "with such infinite pains and care i had endeavoured to form"
    - "watery eyes" and "shriveled complexion"
- Trauama of afterbirth (postpartum depression? nervous breakdown?)
    - "Dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space, were not a hell to me; and the chagne was so rapid" (42).

Shelley's life experiences deny her from being able to care for her child, Victor denies any care for his children
- does your responsibility as a creator end at inception, birth, or maturity?

    - 1818 novel as Shelley's maternal creation

### Victor's Reconciliation
- The restoration of peace of harmony (individual or communal)
    - Contrition: feeling of remorse
        - guilt: feeling of remorse
        - difference: remorse is about acknowledging your responsibility. guiltiness is self-focused, personal loss
    - Confession: admission of guilt
        - denial
        - deflection
    - Penance: action taken to restore virtue
        - retribution: action taken as revenge
    - Absolution: release from guilt and return to harmony

How does he focus on reconciling himself?

Case 1: Justine and William Moritz
- turns from natural philosophy to moral philosophy
- called back to Geneva, motherly intuition confirms his fear that his creature killed William
- recognizes that his responsibility is to confess, but he does nothing
- says its the creature's fault that Justine is being executed, focused on self-horror

Case 2: Reunion
- overcome by guilt, travels to the alps
- reaction to his creation: repulsion, focused on **appearance**
- creatures reaction: Plea for acceptance, calls for **contrition and penance**

Demands:
- listen to my story
- give me companionship

pleas of a lonely being, just wants to be heard and to be loved
- if my parent can not listen to me, or lvoe me, and only sees my exterior, maybe, he can at least give me someone that i can love and can love me back

But then, he aborts the creation progress. disposes of her partially formed body
- is my duty to my creation or to the rest of humanity?
- what might be the effects of my science?
- starts to contemplate just not what he is capable of doing, but the effects of his sciecne on the rest of humanity
- reconciles not just with himself, but with the rest of humanity

Creature's Vengeance:
- you shall repent of the injuries you inflict
- when he returns, he is treated as an outsider/foreigner just like the creature (and Justine i think)
- accused of murder
- acquitted but again stays silence

Fuseli was the lover of Wallstonecraft, the Nightmare

His reaction to Elizabeth's death: "No creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man" (168)
- victim complex

### VIctors Final Labor
- resolves to kill the creature
- "this purpose ... reconciled me to life"
- "revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure"
    - not a genuine reconciliation, he will never find peace and harmony
- confesses
-  issues warning against ambition
    - he is satan and prometheus (180)
- with dying breath, supports ambition
    - glory or death
    - who did he cause the tragedy to? himself
    - fails to apply his lesson to Whalton
