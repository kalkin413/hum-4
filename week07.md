### Haitan Revolution

- first successful large-scale slave revolt in history
- no racial barriers in application of citizenship
- threat to the world order, inspired abolitionoistmovements, slaves, and other subjugated peoples

Sonthonax Emancipation Proclomation
- offers freedom to slaves to get them to fight for France
- strict labor laws
- can't envision a future for San-Doman that doesn't depend on labor in the plantation
- conlfict between ideas of revolution and desires of a country

Toussaint L'Overture
- born a slave but educated
- gets his own plantation and owns slaves
- labor decrees because of economic concerns
    - calling on their resoponsibilities to the community
    - "liberty cannot exist without industry"
    - freedom is not an end in itself
        - like being in an army, one must do their duty as a member of civic society
    - part of being free is accepting inequality for the good of the whole
- constitution
    - extends citizenship beyond racial qualifiers
    - military based society
    - military work as an offer of social progress through merit

Haiti's Declaration of Independence
- "Liberty of Death"
- written after war as opposed to before with the other declarations
- pure rage, deeply personal
- **Montaigne** flips the language of Barbarians
- unifies a Haitian national identity
- "we have daredto be free"
- says the french are no longer free because they failed to own up to their own values in the "Declaration of Rights of Man"

Conclusions
- in deying liberty, equality, and brotherhood to colonial peoples, France is unworthy of its self-proclaimed liberty (and even its humanity)
- Liberty is not a finalized state; it must be fought for and defended constantly
- accepting oppression is not an option; you must recognize it, face it,or die trying
- Liberty comes with responsibility; your duty to defending freedom is like that of a soldier. A free society depends on strength and force of arms
- People who have expereiened freedom can not willingly surrender their freedom
- In the face of violent oppression, violent acts of vengeance and resistance are justified

Americans afraid of haitian revolution inspiring slave revolutions in the US, refuse to recognnize independence

France forced Haiti to pay for the "costs" of its own liberation
- loan isnt repaid until 1947
- cripples the economy from the start

Haitian revolution was seen as a threat to the international order ... and an inspiration to the oppressed and colonized
