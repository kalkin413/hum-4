- unifies a Haitian national identity
- "we have daredto be free"
- says the french are no longer free because they failed to own up to their own values in the "Declaration of Rights of Man"

Conclusions
- in deying liberty, equality, and brotherhood to colonial peoples, France is unworthy of its self-proclaimed liberty (and even its humanity)
- Liberty is not a finalized state; it must be fought for and defended constantly
- accepting oppression is not an option; you must recognize it, face it,or die trying
- Liberty comes with responsibility; your duty to defending freedom is like that of a soldier. A free society depends on strength and force of arms
- People who have expereiened freedom can not willingly surrender their freedom
- In the face of violent oppression, violent acts of vengeance and resistance are justified

Douglass: education as the pathway from slavery to freedom

"The library is the temple of learning, and learning has liberated more people than all the wars in history" - Carl T. Rowan

"We have got to get over the brainwashing we had ... get out of your mind what hte man put in it ... Read everything. You never know where you're going to get an idea. We have to learn how to think ..." - Malcom X

Wallstonecraft also writes that women can gain liberty through education
- "the neglected education of my fellow-creatures is the grand source of the misery I deplore..."
- A "false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men, who ... than affectionate wives and rational mothers"
    - Women's education is determined by men who don't view women as human. it is designed to keep women in line

Women's education, which is determined by men, dehumanizes women
- women are taught to be "insignificant objects of desire"
- Kept in a "state of perpetual childhood, unable to stand alone"
- "slavish dependence"
- perpetuate "weak elegance of mind"

Women's purpose is set by their education
- "the only way women can rise in the world - by marriage"
- "they are taken out of their sphere of duties, and made ridiculous and useless when the short-lived bloom of beauty is over"

### Argument for Women's Education Refor
- the object of education should be to "obtain a character as a human being"
    - women are human beings: "women in common with men, are placed one arth to unfold their faculties'
- Education should "dignify the human character" rather than "render them vain and helpless"
    - Education is the source of individual contributions; education will make woman "affectionate wives and rational mothers" rather than just "alluring mistresses"
- Education is the "foundation of virtue" without which people "spread corrption through the whole of society"
    - Education is the source of social welfare

Counterarguments
- women might become more "masculine" .. oh no!
    - we should all avoid become more "masculine" if it means "hunting shooting and gaming"
- women might tyrannize their husbands
    - the degradation of women "gives birth to cunning" which "produces a propensity to tyrranize"
    - women "play off" the "infantine air" that men assume of them to gain the upper hand over the husbands - women already tyrranize their husbands
    - Marriage should be built on respect and rcognization of intellect not attempts to preserve false hierarchies (Zilia and Aza)
    - It may even happen that the women has "more sense" than her male relatives

Wollstonecraft as an Enlightenment thinker
- Inequality between men and women is social not natural
    - not disputing physical difference (laws of nature)
    - questioning what keep somwen in a state of social inferiority; "immaturity" - artifical ie.e. education system
- Education is an issue of liberty and common good
    - Freedom of thought
    - AGency
    - Maturity (Kant)
    - Social welfare - women will be better wives and mothers, good citizens
    - Nature right
