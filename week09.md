### Nature and Music

sublime: sense of awe
- both music and nature lead to this

awesome : god like (inspires awe like God does in the Judeo-Christian tradition ... lol)
- God doesn't always inspire pleasure, that's not his point
- it is to remind us that we are humans living in a much larger universe and there are things outside our control. Remind ourselves of our humanity

but smallness doesn't make us feel insignificant because we are part of smth larger (universal)

we can't go back to nature, but we can try to recover some feelings of compassion/authenticity and take them back to our lives

What is the cost of technology?

### William Wordsworth

wrote in a fashion that was understandable by general audience, not ornamental language

Themes
- Society, materialisim, and loss of humanity
- restorative power of nature
- awe, sublime, and transaendence
- awe of nature
- nature as a means not an end

transendence from the human to the natural to the universal

experience of nature lives on in our memory
- the wealth we gain by connecting with nature carries on in our daily lives
- when we have memories our imagination augments memories
- this recollection of what we remember influences our present state

Influence on impressionist art
