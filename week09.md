### Nature and Music

sublime: sense of awe
- both music and nature lead to this

awesome : god like (inspires awe like God does in the Judeo-Christian tradition ... lol)
- God doesn't always inspire pleasure, that's not his point
- it is to remind us that we are humans living in a much larger universe and there are things outside our control. Remind ourselves of our humanity

but smallness doesn't make us feel insignificant because we are part of smth larger (universal)

we can't go back to nature, but we can try to recover some feelings of compassion/authenticity and take them back to our lives

What is the cost of technology?

Quiz 5: #2 is Meditative prayer not nonconformity

### Frankenstein

Sublime as a source of Tranquiliy

Sublime as a source of inspiration
- Victor wants to be the one to produce the sublime, not just someone who witnesses it
- Unlike humans, his creation doesn't have the same limitations. It can produce awe

Wordsworth | Shelley
--- | ---
Nature as means vs nature as end | To be like nature vs being with nature
Nature as servant vs nature as venerated master | Replicate nature's creative powers vs. acknowledging nature's creative power
Act of arrogance vs act of humility | Act of arrogance vs act of humility
Exploitation vs. stewardship | Exploitation vs. stewardship

Three Layers (nested)
- Robert Walton's outer frame narrative of letters
- Victor Frankenstein's middle frame narrative of his unfulfilled desire for power through knowledge
- The Creature's inner narrative of his unfulfilled desire for love through companionship

### Walton as Victor Frankenstien

### Walton as the Creature

"i greatly need a friend who woul dhave sense enough not to despise me as romantic" **overly idealistic

Why the frame?
- Letter 4: Walton as Frankenstien and Frankenstein as the Creature

original title: Frankenstien or The Modern Premetheus
1. Prometheus the Fire-Giver
    - steals fire from the gods and gives it to humankind to improve their condition
    - Aeschylus, *Prometheus Bound*, gives humans fire, medidicine, mathematics, astronomy, technology, and augury
        - eternal punishment
    - Percy Shelley, *Prometheus Unbondound*
2. Prometheus Plasticator
    - creates humankind by animating gifures out of clay

Victor as Prometheus Fire=Giver and Plasticator
- progress and consequences of over-acheivement

Prometheus thesis
- Not all science is good science. Progress must be governed by ethical considerations
    - Intention of creation - cannot be personal ambition
    - Supervision of creation - cannot abandon creations
    - Effect of creation - consideration of how creations will impact change in the world

Also references paradise lost
- Adam doesn't understand why God would have created him with the ability to sin and be punished
- If God knows everything, why didn't he stop Adam from eating the apple?

What kind of creator would make a creation who's end goal is to live life in misery?

Shelley's Challenge of Enlightenment Science
- What constitutes progress?
    - ambition, creation as final achievement?
    - caretaking, creation as process and ongoing set of responsibilities
- IS all science "good"?
    - animal testing
    - atomic weapons
- How do we conduct scientific research in an ethical way? How do we create in a moral way?

### Victor as a Scientist
- occulta: supernatural
- he accepts magic (psuedoscience) as hard science
- sees himself as entering into the cult of the esoteric
